# ai-ml-learning-journey

This repository captures my ongoing journey to master AI and Machine Learning, with a special focus on prompt engineering and practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). Here, youâ€™ll find:

1. Summaries and notes from online courses and tutorials
2. Mini projects and scripts using OpenAI API and Python
3. Prompt templates and logs
4. Jupyter notebooks with experiments
5. Documentation and resources to share my progress

I am building this portfolio both to deepen my own understanding and to showcase my skills to potential employers and collaborators. Feedback and collaboration are welcome!
